# Turn a Python script into a Web Application

You write Python code.  You visit websites.  You think to yourself "Making my code into a website sounds hard", so you've never made your code into a website. 

Until now.

That's because right now, you're about to spend about an hour to turn a simple Python function into a website anyone can visit.  That website runs your function and shows the result to your visitors.  This is your first step to "The Social Network"-level fame.  You rejoice*.
