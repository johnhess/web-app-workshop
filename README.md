# Time Travel

Advice I'd have given to myself if I could travel back in time to the moment I started to write code in academia.  In short:

* Write Tests
* Use Version Control
* Putting your code on the web is easy

Why do these things?  Because they make it easier and more effective to do what academics really want to do:

* Be correct
* Collaborate
* Produce/consume replicable
* Publish
